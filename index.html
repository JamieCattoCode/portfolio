    <h3>About Me</h3>>
    <p>My name is Jamie Catto. I am 20 years-old and enjoy history, classic novels and sports.</p>>
    <p>I first got into coding at around 10 years old, as an avid Minecraft fan.
        I learnt the basics of Java so I could code Minecraft plugins. This led me 
        to experimenting with HTML, CSS and Python.
